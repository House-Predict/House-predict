                    The <a href="/predict" >house price prediction</a> model will work on predicting the average budget of construction of houses or flats taking in account of various factors required for construction such as site, materials, workforce, equipment etc. 
                    As it is well known that construction is considered as the backbone of any nations development and is considered as an integral part of any society. Commercial real estate has an economic impact on local communities, as well. In a study conducted by the research foundation, it was determined that pre-construction, construction, and post-construction all have a significant economic benefit when related to commercial real estate. While pre-construction and construction mainly have national benefits, post-construction benefits the local community. The local community benefits from maintenance and repair, cleaning services, utilities, and management, which includes leasing, marketing, security, financial services, and more. As long as the building is in use, the local community continues to bring money in for these services.

                    Numerous problems are faced by people as they start the development of their project. And once they start with it, they generally have no idea how to minimize these problems and work effectively. Due to huge amount of money, time, already invested they have no other option than to work with those problems or use spend too much to get a solution for it. These problems such as budget issues, costly labor, non-availability of materials, expensive construction site, quality of materials, quantity of materials, are they sufficiently available or not etc. All these conditions, equipment and materials require proper customer satisfaction and it requires to fit in their budget. It is generally seen that people start construction of their houses or flats and use best quality problem with highest price in the development. But mid-way of the project they face huge budget issues and are unable to complete these projects. As the result they have to leave the construction as it is and re-start it again when funds get accessed. This happens due to lack of pre-planning and proper deployment. As a matter of fact, this shortage of budget is one of the few primary causes of construction break.
